  max.brk.len = 3e+06)

\description{
Compute the aneuploidy score for a given chromosome
}
\details{
Aneuploidy status is defined as amplified if main copynumber > ploidy; neutral if main copy number and ploidy
are equal; and deleted if main copy number < ploidy. Segments are combined if the aneuploidy status of two adjacent
segments is equal, and the segments do not cross the centromere.
